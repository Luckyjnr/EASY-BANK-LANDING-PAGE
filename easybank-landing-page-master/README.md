This is a solution to the easybank Landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- ### What I learned

I brodened my understanding on HTML, CSS and Javascript base on the little knowledge i have it was challenging but i am getting a hang on it bit by bit.

### Continued development

I wish to learn more about Css and Javascript as i have limited knowledge on this part.
